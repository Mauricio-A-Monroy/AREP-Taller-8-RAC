            "Respuesta: World War II, also known as the Second World War, was a global conflict that lasted from September 1, 1939, to September 2, 1945. It involved two main coalitions: the Allies and the Axis powers. Nearly all of the world's countries participated in the war, which mobilized vast resources in pursuit of total war.\n",
            "\n",
            "The war was characterized by significant military innovations, including the use of tanks and aircraft, which played major roles in battles and enabled strategic bombing of cities. Notably, it was during this conflict that the first and only nuclear weapons were used in warfare.\n",
            "\n",
            "World War II was the deadliest conflict in history, resulting in an estimated 70 to 85 million deaths, with more than half of the casualties being civilians. Many people died as a result of genocides, including the Holocaust, as well as from massacres, starvation, and disease.\n",
            "\n",
            "After the Allied victory, several countries, including Germany, Austria, Japan, and Korea, were occupied, and leaders from Germany and Japan were tried for war crimes. The war had a profound impact on the world, transforming political, economic, and social structures, and establishing the foundation for international relations in the 20th century and beyond.\n",

            "In the aftermath, the United Nations was created to promote international cooperation and prevent future conflicts, with the victorious great powers—China, France, the Soviet Union, the UK, and the U.S.—becoming permanent members of the UN Security Council. The Soviet Union and the U.S. emerged as rival superpowers, leading to the Cold War. The war also spurred the decolonization of many countries in Africa and Asia, as the influence of European powers waned.\n",
